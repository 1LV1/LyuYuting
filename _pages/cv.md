Research experience
======
* 2021-now: 
  * Advisor: He Yu
  * Institute of Quantum Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology
  * STM Laboratory of Semiconductor Quantum Dots Quantum Computing research group
  * The current research project is the quantum simulation of critical phase based on semiconductor quantum dots systems. The completed topics include single electron transistors with steady transport properties, single electron pumps with multi-quantum dot transport characteristics, integrating 3D top electrode alignment techniques, etc. I have participated in the entire process, from the building to the maturity of experimental systems, and I am familiar with STM and MBE combined ultra-high vacuum systems.
  * As novel artificial quantum materials, semiconductor quantum simulation chips are processed by STM hydrogen depassivation lithography, experimentally simulating Anderson localization, critical phase and other condensed matter physical phenomena. During the long-term operating of STM ultrahigh vacuum systems combined with MBE, laser direct writing machine, SEM and other micro and nano fabrication equipment, rich experimental skills and experience have been cultivated and accumulated. The segregation of doped atoms, the low-temperature homogeneous epitaxy of Si, the quantum transport of single-electron transistors (SETs) and single-electron pumps (SEPs), 3D integrated top electrode technology, the quantum simulation of the SSH model and other subjects have been researched through theoretical calculation, software simulation and improvement of equipment design, etc. Important technical problems such as the influence of high-energy electrons on device diffusion and the balance between the coupling strength and breakdown voltage of two-dimensional gate electrodes have been overcome.

* 2021: 
  * Advisor: Zhang Jianjun
  * Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
  * N09 Semiconductor Quantum Materials and Devices research group
  * Utilizing semiconductor molecular beam epitaxial growth technology, the subject of semiconductor nanodots and nanowires epitaxial growth based on the susaturated infiltrated layer of silicon-germanium substrate had been studied. Meanwhile, the experience and skills for MBE equipment in the heterologous epitaxy of carbon group semiconductors and the controlled nucleation and growth of nanodots and nanowires had been accumulated.

 
* 2020:
  * Advisor: Li Weidong
  * Institute of Theoretical Physics, Shanxi University
  * Theoretical research on Rabi oscillation and Rabi spectrum was carried out, and the graduation thesis completed based on this topic was awarded as the outstanding undergraduate graduation thesis of Shanxi University in 2020.
  * In the analysis of the quantization of space in the rotating magnetic field, the transition probability between the eigenstates of the magnetic field representation is solved. It is found that the magnetic field direction will directly affect the coupling strength between the eigenstate coefficients and the angular frequency of the transition probability oscillation. In order to make it suitable for practical measurement, the Rabi model is simplified in that the coupling between the diagonal term and the non-diagonal term is removed. Considering its quantum factors, the optimal working conditions are found. 

* 2018-2019:
  * Independent research on the subject of laser medical image segmentation.
  * In order to solve the technical difficulties of existing laser medical image processing methods, an adjacency Gaussian mixture model is proposed, which significantly improves the segmentation accuracy and anti-noise performance of laser medical images. I participated in the 14th National Conference on Laser Technology and Optoelectronics (LTO 2019) and the Chinese Optical Ten Progress in 2018 and gave an oral report at the conference. As the first author, I published the paper "Laser Medical Image Processing Based on Neighborhood Concerning Gaussian Mixture Model", Collected by SPIE Digital Library.


* 2018:
  * Mathematical model of thermal performance of thermal protective clothing
  * A three-dimensional unsteady heat conduction model was established to determine the design parameters of clothing for high-temperature operation. The nested concentric multi-cylinder model established for the "human-void-fabric" system can realize the geometric restoration of the special clothing dummy experiment to a certain extent. This model has significant advantages in the parameter design of special clothing for high-temperature operation and embodies good universality in the continuation problem of special clothing design for low-temperature operation. I acted as the group leader in this subject, responsible for modelling, paper writing and some programming work. This work won the National Second Prize in the National Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling.
